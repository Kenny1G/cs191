Storylines Image Search is an application that allows you to search for images using natural language queries.
Here's how to use it:
1. **Setup Demo**: Enter a unique ID and authenticate with Google Photos API.
2. **Upsert Images**: Select a date range to fetch images from your Google Photos account. The images are then embedded and stored in a Pinecone vector index.
3. **Image Search**: Enter a natural language query to search for images. \
You can refine your search by adding more queries. Once you find your target image, click 'Accept' to train the system and improve future searches.
